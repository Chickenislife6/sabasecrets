1. Check if message franking is built into libsignal

1.5. add the ability to add multiple one time keys so people can actually send multiple messages

2. refactor code (specifically make locations and such consistent)

3. try to add interfaces and type more things, especially api (maybe trpc in the future?)

4. work on ui

5. add wss support for realtime messages

6. getting messages based on time/chat/user

7. chat rooms vs global chat

8. group chats with multi-party diffie hellman? (might be really hard with libsignal protocol)
