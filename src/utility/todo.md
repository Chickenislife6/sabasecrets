1. remove items from localstorage, store in more secure way

2. Check if using Math.floor(10000 \* Math.random()); is a secure way of generating base Id
   this may be ok because the registrationid and identity keys are generated safely

3. generalize serialize? kinda scuffed atm and maybe needs better structure/placement/documentation
